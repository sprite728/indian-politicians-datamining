	- Harsh Vardhan
	- Shri Harsh Vardhan
2. There are two Mahadeo Singh Khandela in the html files, but one in the politicians.csv (Which one is which?)
	- Mahadeo Singh Khandela
	- Shri Mahadeo Singh Khandela
3. In html files, there are "Ajay Makan" with bday "NA" and Ajay Maken with bday "12/1/1964", and in the politicians.csv file there is only a "Ajay Makan" with bday "NA"

4. In the html files, there is "Shri Abhijit Mukherjee" with bday 2/1/1960 and "Abhijit Mukherjee" with bday 1/2/1960. Are they two different people or that's the problem with the html files?

5. There are  "Ramashankar Rajbhar" with bday NA and "Shri Ramashankar Rajbhar" with bday 1/1/1960 in the html files. Only one "Ramashankar Rajbhar" with bday NA in the politicians.csv file
